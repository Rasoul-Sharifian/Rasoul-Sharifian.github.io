## About Me

I am currently an industrial Ph.D. student in computer vision, under the supervision of Professor Adrien Bartoli. My research is mainly about deformable registration, and Augmented Reality in Minimally Invasive Surgeries. My contract is CIFRE, a type of contract in France that enables companies to collaborate with universities solving their research issues. Before pursuing my Ph.D., I worked as a research engineer at EnCoV-Institute Pascale, CNRS. I have experience in X-ray imaging systems, dealing with inspection and Treatment Planning Systems in radiotherapy. Additionally, I have several years of experience as a ping pong coach and player!
